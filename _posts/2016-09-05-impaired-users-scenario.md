# Scenarios

## Past Scenarios

**_Plus_**

Sveinbjörn has to add another assignment to his course at the college. He would have been able to do it in his phone, the task is simple enough, but the the screen is just too darn small. He adds the assignment in his home computer where he has a big monitor.

**_Minus_**

Sveinbjörn is on a trip with his family in France. He enjoys being able to have flexible hours and locations because of the nature of his job. He gets an e-mail in his phone from a student. He can’t quite read the text but he is able to gather that it has something to do about a problem with the upcoming assignment. He has to wait until he gets back home a few days later where he has a big monitor.

## Future Scenarios

_**Plus**_

Sveinbjörn is out and about. His son has helped him install Magnifier to his smartphone. Now he can do some real work on his phone when he isn’t home. Suddenly he realizes there is a meeting he has forgotten that present day. He doesn’t remember what time it is so he isn’t sure if he is late or has plenty of time to spare. He goes on the school's inner web to check on the schedule. He fires up his Magnifying tool using an on screen shortcut so he can zoom into the details and see the time of the meeting. He sees that it starts after 30 minutes so he can catch it if he hurries up.

_**Minus**_

Sveinbjörn has an important message to send to his students and needs to send it quickly. He goes on the school’s inner web but then realizes the on screen shortcut to the Magnifying toon isn’t showing. He doesn’t remember how his son set it up for him and isn’t sure if he somehow turned it off without realizing it or if is someone else’s fault. He has to wait until his son comes home from school to set the tool up for him again.
