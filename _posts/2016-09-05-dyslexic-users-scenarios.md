## Past Scenarios

**_Plus_**

George has had an eventful day at the office, but only had to use the company’s website, because it is designed with dyslexic needs in mind, he hasn’t had any trouble related to his special needs. Also there is summer break at school so no inconvenience was to be had because of that.


**_Minus_**

George got a request from one of his clients to look at a rivals website and make a client a better offer than they did. His troubles start right when he opens up the site and he can hardly read any of the texts. He had to get his colleague to help him sift through the data and felt ashamed.

## Future Scenarios

_**Plus**_

George has a busy day ahead of him, he has to do a research for a paper for school, about the pros and cons of social media in advertising. This involves looking through dozens of web pages of different kinds, he installs the Reformer app in his chrome browser and anytime he has difficulty reading something presses the “Reformat” button which changes the background to a creamy color and all text becomes dark blue. He completes his task earlier than he expected and decides to go hiking this afternoon.

_**Minus**_

George is at the office and has a brand new computer from the IT department, he gets yet another request from a client about making him better offers than a rival company, so he hits up the browser, in this case only Microsoft Edge is installed. So he decides to go quickly install Chrome, his computer won’t allow him because he is not an administrator, his client is getting restless on the phone and George has to forward the call to another sales rep because he just cannot read anything clearly on that site.
