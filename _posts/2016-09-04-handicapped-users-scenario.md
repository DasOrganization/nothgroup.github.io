## Past Scenarios

**_Plus_**

Gabrielle‘s at work and having a quiet day. Her assignment today is to make an organizational chart for the staff. She often has problems with her limbs and when it happens it is very difficult for her to control it.Gabrielle had no problem today and used her mouse with the computer to make the chart easily. She did everything right on time without any stress.


**_Minus_**

Gabrielle‘s at work and it‘s a holiday, therefore she‘s really busy at work. She has loads of assignments and is feeling stressed. Gabrielle is painful and can‘t control her limbs fully. She can barely use the mouse for her computer so her assignments take longer time. She gets really stressed and has to take a little break.

## Future Scenarios

_**Plus**_

Gabrielle has a busy day at work and has to make an organizational chart for the staff. She has full control of her limbs and uses the mouse for her computer. A new software has been purchased for Gabrielle which is a camera that is put on top of a screen. The camera tracks her motion of her eyes and she uses her eyes to control the mouse. To use the click function for the mouse she has to blink hard. Gabrielle decides to try out the new software and she is a fast learner. The use of the software goes smooth and Gabrielle is fairly quicker doing her assignments with the new camera mouse.

_**Minus**_

Gabrielle has a really busy day at work and she has to send a private e-mail to one of her personnel. The e-mail includes private information about the company which is not for all personnel. She decides to use the new software the camera mouse. She sends the email but accidentally sent the email to all the staff at work. The camera mouse did not track her eye movements correctly. Gabrielle has to apologize to everyone and tell them that is was an accident. Now everybody at work knows about the private information which is not tolerable.
