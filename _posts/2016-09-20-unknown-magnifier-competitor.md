# Unknown -  A Magnifier Competitor 

There is a magnifying tool built into the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, but I don’t know what it’s called (or if it has a name). It works by pressing the pen function icon and selecting the magnifying feature. After that, when you hover over something, it will be magnified.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strenghts**


- Intuitive
- A utility designed around the UI it’s used in
- Works well
- Incomplex




**Weaknesses**


- Only available for the Galaxy Note
- Doesn’t allow for customization 



### Further Information

Available on Galaxy Note 7
