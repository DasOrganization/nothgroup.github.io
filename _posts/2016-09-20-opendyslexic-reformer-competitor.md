# OpenDyslexic -  A ReFormer Competitor 

It is a open source Chrome extension that overrides all text on web pages with a font that is designed by them and also reformats the pages to help people with dyslexia read.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strenghts**


- Free and open source
- Has great support for some popular web sites example:  imgur, NYTimes and Wall Street Journal
- Has an on/off button
- Is multiplatform
- Some android and iOS have it built in

- Has ads
- Seems to have an uninstall problem. Users are having trouble removing it from their system.
- Has only one set of fonts/formatting, might not work for everyone
