# Blue Bongos - Presenting The Vision

To gain a better understanding of how our vision, would fit into our users needs, we reached out to three different potential users. The users were presented with our vision and asked to individually, evaluate and rate the vision. Overall feedback from the users was positive. One user, liked the visual feedback of the child's progress and ability to collect data. Other user liked how Blue Bongos combines playing and learning. The third user pointed out, that the games should have research and empirical evidence, behind how the will support a child's learning progress.
