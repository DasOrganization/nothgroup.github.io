# Scenarios

## Past Scenarios

**_Plus_**

Tom has been having difficulties learning how to read at school. After school one day, Hannah picks up a comic book and sits down with Tom. Hannah writes a sentence to a piece of paper and Tom then reads the sentence. After reading the sentence Tom matches it to a page in the comic book. Hannah keeps track of Tom&#39;s score and logs it down to her diary.  After finishing the session Hannah calculates the final score and compares to previous values.

Hannah recently got a new job and now has little time to spend with Tom. George takes over helping Tom overcome his reading difficulties. George uses the same method as Hannah and sits down with Tom, writes down sentences and Tom matches them to a page. George forgets to keep track of Tom&#39;s score and to log it down after each session. Hannah want&#39;s to see if Tom is making progress but is unable to due to the lack of data.

## Future Scenarios

_**Plus**_

Hannah picks Tom up from school at 3 and as soon as they get home Tom asks for the iPad. She then sits down with Tom, picks up the iPad, opens up the learning app. Tom has been having difficulties learning how to read so Hannah selects reading category. Hannah then hands the iPad over to Tom, who is eager to play. Tom starts a new game and matches words and sentences to comics. Hannah picks up the iPad again after Tom finishes the session and looks at app&#39;s metrics. The metrics show both scores and progression over time. Hannah is happy that the metrics show that Tom has almost reached third grade level reading ability.

_**Minus**_

Every weekend during the summer the family goes out to visit Tom&#39;s grandparents. During the drive Tom asks to play the game on the iPad. George picks up the iPad and opens up the app. Tom asks to play the emotion game where he needs to analyze picture. George selects the category and hands over the iPad to Tom. Tom starts playing the game, matching emotions to pictures. In the middle of the game play, the iPad looses it&#39;s network connection and presents a dialog. By accident Tom selects the option to quit the game and looses all his progress. Tom becomes unsettled and starts crying and screaming.  Hannah stops the car and calms Tom down.
