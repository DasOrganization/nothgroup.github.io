## 5W + H

**What:** An app that makes a magnifying window on top of the interface of the smartphone.

**Where:** Anywhere the keep their smartphone with them.

**When:** Whenever they need to read or look at something small in their smartphones or other small-screen devices.

**Who:** People with bad vision who find it hard to see small things.

**Why:** So they can see what is written on the screen. E.g. if the user needs to read an e-mail but canâ€™t read it because the font is too small. He could use the magnifying tool to make the text bigger.

**How:** By pressing an on screen shortcut for starting up the tool, a window opens up that magnifies everything behind it. The window can be moved or resized into full screen.
